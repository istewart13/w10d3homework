The factory pattern is one of the most commonly used design patterns and is used to create objects centrally, without having to call a constructor and specify what class of object is required. A factory method is instead used to create objects - it just needs to be asked for a new object and told what type of object his needs to be.

To implement it you need to:

- Create an interface
- Create concrete classes implementing that interface
- Create a Factory to generate objects of a concrete class based on the given information
- Use the Factory to get objects of a concrete class by passing in information such as type
